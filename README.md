# HauFacebook

This project allowed me to apply my knowledge in ReactJS, Node.js, and Firebase, where I overcame challenges related to implementing user authentication, managing posts, and using Firebase for real-time data. I utilized a variety of online resources, including tutorials, to solve real-world problems.

## Features

- **User Authentication** using Firebase Authentication (with Google login)
- **Firestore Database** for storing user data and posts
- **Material UI** components for a sleek and responsive user interface
- **Firebase Hosting** for deployment
- **Firebase Functions** for handling backend logic (optional based on your implementation)
